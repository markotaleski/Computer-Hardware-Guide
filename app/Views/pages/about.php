        At the present time nearly everyone has access to a computer, whether that be a smartphone, a tablet, a laptop or a PC. The computer has proven itself as the most useful and revolutionary invention man has ever crated. As a matter of fact some type of a computer can be found in all electronics we use in our day to day lives.<br>
        A part of what makes a computer live is its hardware. Hardware as a term implies the physical parts of the computer, such as GPU, CPU, power unit and many more. With extensive use of the computer some hardware components may fail and malfunction, which consecutively will lead to the computer cease to function. Getting these malfunctioning or broken components fixed can be very expensive, even replacing the damaged components with a newly bought ones can be expensive. The question the arises why pay an expensive fee to get these components fixed or changed when you could do it yourself just by watching one to two videos.
